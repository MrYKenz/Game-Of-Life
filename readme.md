# Game of Life in Vanilla JS
Mathematician John Conway's Game of Life created with no javascript libraries- using HTML5 Canvas and related JS functions.
Allows for drawing with mouse pointer to create / kill cells using mouseEvents.
Stop and Run buttons added to give time to draw create populations because single cells die with each frame (or second).

### This is a cellular automaton simulation with the following rules:
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
